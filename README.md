# Bastion: Transformer-Based End-to-End Web Application Firewall (WAF) Pipeline

## Problem Statement:

Traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) primarily utilize rule-based detection such as ModSecurity. While effective against known attack patterns, they struggle to identify zero-day exploits and novel anomalies due to the limitations of static rulesets. Transformer models, with their capacity to learn complex patterns from raw web traffic, present a powerful alternative. By leveraging Transformers, a WAF can potentially detect anomalous requests without reliance on hard-coded signatures, thereby enhancing protection against unknown threats.

**## Key Deliverables:**

* End-to-end log processing pipeline 
* Transformer-based anomaly detection model 
* Real-time integration with Apache/Nginx 
* Non-blocking, high-throughput inference engine 
* Automated continuous learning framework 

## Data Flow

1.  **Log Collection:** Apache/Nginx logs → Ingestion Module (batch or streaming) 
2.  **Parsing:** Raw logs → Structured key-value pairs with normalization 
3.  **Tokenization:** Normalized requests → Token sequences 
4.  **Inference:** Token sequences → Transformer model → Anomaly scores 
5.  **Detection:** Anomaly scores → Threshold comparison → Action (log/alert/block) 
6.  **Retraining:** New benign traffic → Incremental model update 

**## Key advantages of this approach:**

* **Adaptive Learning:** Continuous improvement from new traffic patterns 
* **Zero-Day Protection:** Detection of previously unseen attack patterns 
* **Non-Blocking Architecture:** Real-time inference without disrupting legitimate traffic 
* **Scalability:** Batch and streaming processing for various deployment scenarios 
* **Maintainability:** Clean separation of concerns and modular design 

## Conclusion

This comprehensive solution provides a production-ready Transformer-based Web Application Firewall that combines the power of deep learning with practical deployment considerations. By following this architecture and implementation guide, teams can build a WAF system that learns from benign traffic patterns and detects novel anomalies in real time without the limitations of static rule-based systems.
